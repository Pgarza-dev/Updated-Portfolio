Hello! I'm Pablo Garza, a Frontend Developer based out of Oslo, Norway. Welcome to my portfolio!

## About Me

I am a dedicated Web Developer from originally from the United States living in
Oslo, Norway after retiring from the UFC.As I emersed myself deeper into coding, my passion for it grew stronger,
leading me to discover the Frontend Development Education at Noroff. At
Noroff I've been able to grow at a much faster pace and built this
portfolio with some of my various projects.
I'm currently seeking a job as a Frontend Developer in and around the Oslo
area, so if you like what you see, please feel free to contact me via email
or LinkedIn. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges.‚úåÔ∏èü§û
